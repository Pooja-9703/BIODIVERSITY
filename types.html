                <h3 class="type_name">1. Genetic Diversity</h3>
                <p class="type_des">This refers to the variety of genes within a species.
                    It includes the different traits, variations,
                    and genetic makeup among individuals of the same species.
                    Genetic diversity is crucial for species' adaptability to environmental changes,
                    resistance to diseases, and overall survival. It also provides
                    the basis for selective breeding in agriculture and conservation efforts,
                    ensuring the preservation of unique genetic traits.

                <h3 class="type_name">2. Species Diversity</h3>
                <p class="type_des">This aspect of biodiversity pertains to the variety
                    of different species within a particular ecosystem or on the entire planet.
                    It involves the number of different species present and their relative abundance.
                    Higher species diversity typically leads to more stable and resilient ecosystems.
                    Conserving species diversity is vital for maintaining the complex web of
                    interactions within ecosystems, as each species contributes uniquely to the functioning of the
                    ecosystem.

                <h3 class="type_name">3. Ecosystem Diversity</h3>
                <p class="type_des">Ecosystem diversity refers to the variety of different habitats, biomes,
                    and ecological processes within a region or the entire planet. It encompasses the diversity
                    of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, wetlands, coral reefs, deserts, and more.
                    Each ecosystem has its own unique set of species and interactions, providing various ecosystem
                    services,
                    such as water purification, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling. Preserving ecosystem diversity
                    is
                    essential for maintaining a range of services that benefit human societies and the planet's health.
