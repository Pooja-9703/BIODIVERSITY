                <h3 class="type_name">1. Ecosystem Services</h3>
                <p class="type_des">Biodiversity supports various ecosystem services essential for human survival,
                    including clean air, water purification, pollination of crops, soil fertility, and natural resources
                    that sustain agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.

                <h3 class="type_name">2. Medicine and Pharmaceuticals:</h3>
                <p class="type_des">Many medications and medical treatments are derived from natural compounds found in
                    diverse plant and animal species. Biodiversity provides a rich source for discovering new drugs and
                    treatments.

                <p class="type_des">Biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems ensures diverse crops and livestock. Genetic
                    diversity in species supports resilience against diseases, pests, and environmental changes,
                    contributing to food security.

                <h3 class="type_name">4. Climate Regulation</h3>
                <p class="type_des">Diverse ecosystems play a vital role in regulating climate patterns by sequestering
                    carbon, influencing local weather, and providing resilience against extreme events such as floods
                    and droughts.

                <h3 class="type_name">5. Cultural and Recreational Value</h3>
                <p class="type_des">Biodiversity enriches our lives culturally, offering aesthetic, recreational, and
                    spiritual value. Many cultural practices and traditions are deeply intertwined with diverse species
                    and ecosystems.

                <h3 class="type_name">6. Economic Benefits</h3>
                <p class="type_des"> Biodiversity contributes significantly to global economies through tourism,
                    recreational activities, and various industries like agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and
                    biotechnology.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="type_des">Preserving biodiversity is essential for ensuring a sustainable and healthy environment
                for future generations, maintaining the balance of ecosystems, and securing the well-being of human
                societies. Loss of biodiversity can disrupt these critical ecological services, impacting human health,
                economies, and the overall stability of the planet.</p>
